# Run marker detection on a matrix by cell type

For each cell type, compute markers for:

- Most Adverse within that cell type vs all other groups within that
  cell type

- Most Favorable within that cell type vs all other groups within that
  cell type

## Usage

``` r
run_markers_on_matrix_by_celltype(
  mat,
  group_vec,
  cell_type_vec,
  min.pct = 0.1,
  logfc.threshold = 0.25,
  pval_threshold = 0.05,
  max_cells_per_ident = 5000L,
  verbose = TRUE
)
```
